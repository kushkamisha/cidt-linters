# Linters

## About

Solhint, prettier, and eslint configs for a basic Truffle or Hardhat project on JS

## How to use

1. Copy the following files to your newly created JS Truffle/Hardhat project:

- .eslintignore
- .eslintrc
- .prettierrc
- .solhint.json
- .solhintignore
- .gitignore
- [optional] Linters.code-workspace

<i>Note: copy Linters.code-workspace file only if you're using VS Code. This file will help you to create a project in VS Code. You may want to rename it to correspond to the name of your project.</i>

2. Install the dev dependencies from `example-package.json` file. You may want to upgrade them to use the lastest version available.
3. [optional] Copy scripts from `example-package.json`. They will help to run linter commands
